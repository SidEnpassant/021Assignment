Open Orders Page - Mobile UI  
I created this Open Orders page based on the web-based UI provided to me. My main goal was to build a clean, intuitive, and fast user interface that works well on mobile screens while keeping the functionality and look of the original design.

1) Core Philosophy & Approach  
My approach to building this application was guided by three main principles:

Mobile-First Responsive Design: I did not just shrink the web UI; I redesigned it for mobile use. Complex elements, like the multi-column table, are changed into clear, easy-to-read Cards. Content that overflows horizontally, such as the market ticker, can now be scrolled. Primary navigation is placed in a standard mobile Drawer for an easy user experience.

Clean Architecture: To make sure the app is scalable, maintainable, and testable, I strictly followed the principles of Clean Architecture. The business logic is completely separate from the UI and data sources. This allows me to easily switch the UI from Flutter to another framework or change the data source from a mock API to a real-time WebSocket, with minimal changes to the core business rules.

Declarative UI with Provider State Management: I chose Provider, a simple but effective state management solution, to manage the app's state. When data changes, such as the list of orders, or when filters are applied, the UI updates and rebuilds only the necessary widgets. This declarative approach results in code that is more predictable and easier to debug.

2) Project Structure  
The project is organized into layers according to Clean Architecture, making it easy to navigate and understand where different pieces of logic are located.
